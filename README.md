# Game Overview
The Coconut Shy game is an innovative Unity-based project that merges traditional gameplay with augmented
reality (AR) through Vuforia, bringing a classic fairground challenge into the digital age. Players engage in
knocking down coconuts(here cylindrical cans) placed on the floor by throwing balls, with the game offering
varying levels of difficulty to cater to all skill levels. The AR version uses the Vuforia engine to overlay game
elements onto the real world, enhancing player immersion by allowing physical interaction with the game
through the device’s camera. This blend of physical skill, strategy, and digital augmentation offers a unique
gaming experience across both AR and non-AR platforms.

AR Version: Incorporates Vuforia to merge game elements with the real world, enhancing interactivity through physical device movement.


# **Development Tools and Framework**

Unity 3D: Selected for its comprehensive suite of game development tools, Unity 3D facilitates the creation
of both 2D and 3D games. The platform’s versatility in physics handling, animation, and environmental design
is crucial for developing the coconut shy game’s intricate mechanics and engaging visuals.
